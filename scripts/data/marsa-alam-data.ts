      { question: 'Can I really see dugongs in Marsa Alam?', answer: 'Yes! Abu Dabbab Bay is one of the very few places in the world where dugongs (sea cows) can be reliably spotted. They come to feed on the seagrass beds in the shallow bay. Sightings are common but not guaranteed as they are wild animals.' },
      { question: 'What is the best time to visit Marsa Alam?', answer: 'Marsa Alam enjoys year-round warm weather and diving conditions. October to May offers the most pleasant temperatures (22-30°C). Summer (June-September) is hotter but the sea remains beautiful and less crowded.' },
      { question: 'Do I need diving certification for the tours?', answer: 'Our snorkeling tours require no certification. For scuba diving, we offer Discover Scuba (beginner) programs and advanced dives for certified divers. PADI courses are also available.' },
      { question: 'How far is Marsa Alam from Hurghada?', answer: 'Marsa Alam is about 270 km south of Hurghada (approximately 3-3.5 hours by road). Marsa Alam has its own international airport with direct flights from Europe.' },
