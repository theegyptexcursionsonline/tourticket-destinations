      { question: 'What is the best time of year to visit Luxor?', answer: 'October to April offers the most comfortable weather with temperatures between 20-30°C. Summer months (June-August) can exceed 45°C, so early morning tours and hot air balloon rides are strongly recommended during that period.' },
      { question: 'How many days do I need to explore Luxor?', answer: 'We recommend at least 2-3 days to comfortably visit the major sites. One day for the West Bank (Valley of the Kings, Hatshepsut Temple, Colossi of Memnon) and one day for the East Bank (Karnak and Luxor Temples). A third day allows for a hot air balloon ride and day trips to Dendera or Abydos.' },
      { question: 'Do I need to buy separate entrance tickets for each tomb?', answer: 'Your tour price includes standard entrance fees. The Valley of the Kings general ticket covers 3 tombs. Entry to Tutankhamun\'s tomb and the tomb of Seti I require separate premium tickets, which can be arranged through your guide.' },
      { question: 'Is the hot air balloon ride safe?', answer: 'Yes! Our balloon operators are fully licensed with excellent safety records. Flights take place at sunrise when winds are calmest. All pilots are certified with thousands of flight hours over Luxor.' },
      { question: 'What should I wear when visiting temples and tombs?', answer: 'Comfortable walking shoes are essential as you will be on uneven ground. Light, breathable clothing that covers shoulders and knees is recommended. Bring a hat, sunscreen, and plenty of water, especially in warmer months.' },
      { question: 'Do you offer hotel pickup in Luxor?', answer: 'Yes, free hotel pickup and drop-off is included with every tour from all hotels on both the East Bank and West Bank of Luxor.' },
