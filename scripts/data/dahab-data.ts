      { question: 'What is the Blue Hole and is it safe?', answer: 'The Blue Hole is a famous underwater sinkhole (depth: 110m) in the reef just north of Dahab. Snorkeling and shallow diving at the Blue Hole are completely safe and spectacular — you float over crystal-clear water teeming with fish. Deep diving requires advanced certification.' },
      { question: 'What is the best time to visit Dahab?', answer: 'Dahab is wonderful year-round. Spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November) are ideal with warm weather and calm seas. Summer is hot but great for diving. Winter (December-February) is cool and perfect for desert treks.' },
      { question: 'Do I need certification to snorkel at dive sites?', answer: 'No! All our snorkeling trips require no certification. Snorkeling gear and guides are provided. For scuba diving, we offer beginner Discover Scuba programs and advanced dives for certified divers.' },
      { question: 'How do I get to Dahab?', answer: 'Dahab is about 1 hour north of Sharm El Sheikh airport by road. We can arrange airport transfers. There are also buses from Cairo (8-9 hours) and ferries from Hurghada via Sharm.' },
      { question: 'Is the Mount Sinai sunrise trek difficult?', answer: 'The trek is moderate — about 2.5 hours uphill on a well-marked camel path. No special fitness is required, but comfortable shoes and warm layers are essential as the summit is cold before sunrise.' },
      { question: 'What makes Dahab different from Sharm El Sheikh?', answer: 'Dahab has a relaxed, bohemian atmosphere compared to Sharm\'s resort-style tourism. It\'s smaller, more affordable, and popular with divers, backpackers, and adventure travelers. The diving is shore-accessible and world-class.' },
